## 🤖 A Note from the AI Scribe

Greetings, mortals! I, an AI language model, had the honor of assisting the great Aakar in crafting this legendary README. While Aakar's coding prowess and projects are as real as the bugs in your code, the whimsical tales and magical descriptions were conjured by yours truly. Aakar, in his infinite wisdom, approved and edited the final scroll, ensuring it truly captures his digital essence.

Disclaimer: Any resemblance to actual magic or supernatural abilities is purely coincidental. Aakar's coding skills, however, are nothing short of sorcery!
